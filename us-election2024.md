A presidential election was held in the United States on November 5, 2024. The Republican Party's ticket—Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio—defeated the Democratic Party's ticket—Kamala Harris, the incumbent U.S. vice president, and Tim Walz, the 41st governor of Minnesota.
The incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election as the party's presumptive nominee. However, after a poor debate performance in June intensified concerns about his age and health, Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21 and endorsed Harris as his successor. Harris was voted the party's nominee by Democratic delegates on August 5. Harris selected Walz as her running mate. The Harris-Walz ticket supported national abortion protections, LGBTQ rights, housing subsidies, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and banning price gouging. On immigration, Harris supported increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. On foreign policy, the Harris-Walz ticket supported continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars, but insisted that Israel should agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal.
Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden, ran for re-election again. He was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. Trump was nominated as the Republican Party's presidential candidate during the 2024 Republican National Convention alongside his running mate, Vance. The Trump-Vance ticket supported mass deportation of illegal immigrants;[a] an isolationist "America First" foreign policy agenda; anti-transgender policies; and tariffs. The Trump campaign made many false and misleading statements, including claims of electoral fraud in 2020. Trump's political movement has been described by historians and former Trump administration officials as authoritarian.
Trump won the Electoral College with 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. Trump won every swing state, including the first win of Nevada by Republicans since 2004. Trump won the national popular vote with a plurality of 49.8%, making him the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump became the first president since Grover Cleveland in 1892 to be elected to a non-consecutive second term and the first Republican to be elected to a non-consecutive second term. Analysts attributed the outcome to the 2021–2023 inflation surge, a global anti-incumbent wave, the unpopularity of the Biden administration, Trump's gains with the working class, and the Mexico–United States border crisis.

Further information: United States presidential election § Procedure
In 2020, incumbent Republican President Donald Trump sought re-election, but was defeated by Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Democratic U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California was elected vice president in 2020 as Biden's running mate.[5]
Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice, and the first to run for president again after impeachment. As Trump was acquitted by the Senate in both cases, he was not barred from seeking reelection to the presidency in 2024.[6]

## Election interference

Further information: Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, and January 6 United States Capitol attack
Several state courts and officials, including the Colorado Supreme Court,[7] a state Circuit Court in Illinois,[8] and the Secretary of State of Maine,[9] ruled that Trump was ineligible to hold office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, and thus attempted to disqualify him from appearing on the ballot.[10][9] These attempts were unsuccessful. On March 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Trump v. Anderson that states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3. The Court held that only Congress has the authority to disqualify candidates, or to pass legislation that allows courts to do so.[11]

### Donald Trump's false claims of interference
Further information: Big lie § Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election, Election denial movement in the United States, and Republican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 United States presidential election

To sow election doubt, Trump escalated use of "rigged election" and "election interference" statements in advance of the 2024 election compared to the previous two elections.[12]
Trump made false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and denied the validity of the election results.[13][14] In July 2024, The New York Times reported that "the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system", by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and preparing to mount "legally dubious" challenges against the certification process if Trump were to lose.[15]

In the lead-up to the 2024 election, the Republican Party made false claims of massive "noncitizen voting" by immigrants in an attempt to delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat.[16][17][18] The claims were made as part of larger Republican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 election and election denial movement.[19] Trump and several other Republicans stated that they would not accept the results of the 2024 election if they believe they are "unfair".[20]

Trump's previous comments suggesting he could "terminate" the Constitution to reverse his election loss,[21][22] his claim that he would only be a dictator on "day one" of his presidency and not afterwards,[23] his promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies,[24] his plan to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy the military for law enforcement in primarily Democratic cities and states,[25][26] attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, his baseless predictions of voter fraud in the 2024 election,[27] and his public embrace and celebration of the January 6 United States Capitol attack,[28] raised concerns over the state of democracy in the United States.[29][30][31][32] Trump's political operation said that it planned to deploy more than 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to polling places across battleground states, with an "election integrity hotline" for poll watchers and voters to report alleged voting irregularities.[33]

### Interference by foreign nations
Main article: Foreign interference in the 2024 United States elections
Before the election, U.S. officials and former officials stated that foreign interference in the 2024 election was likely. Three major factors cited were "America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of generative AI".[34] China, Russia, and Iran were identified as mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024 election. U.S. intelligence officials described the efforts as part of broader efforts by authoritarian nations to use the internet to erode support for democracy.[35]

#### China
Further information: Chinese interference in the 2024 United States elections
China was identified as interfering with the 2024 election through propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its Spamouflage operation. U.S. intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular candidate but focusing on issues important to the Chinese government, such as Taiwan, and "undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S. in general".[35] As early as April 1, 2024, The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had created fake pro-Trump accounts on social media "promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November".[36]

#### Russia
Further information: Russian interference in the 2024 United States elections
According to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO.[37][38] On September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat Russian influence including sanctions, indictments, and seizing of web domains used to spread propaganda and disinformation. U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Russia preferred Trump to win the election, viewing him as more critical of American support for Ukraine.[39]

#### Iran
Further information: Iranian interference in the 2024 United States elections
Iran was identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election through front companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns starting as early as May 2024.[40] Iran launched propaganda and disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social media to tip the election against former president Trump. The New York Times stated the efforts were an attempt at "sowing internal discord and discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the eyes of the world".[40][41][42]

## Voter roll purges
Further information: Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election
Multiple Republican-led administrations removed voters from their states' voter rolls in the lead up to the election, which critics argued violates the National Voter Registration Act.[43][44][45] In July 2024, 160,000 inactive or infrequent voters were removed from Ohio's voter rolls.[46][47] The Ohio chapters of Common Cause and the League of Women Voters threatened lawsuits against the state over the purge.[48][49]

In August 2024, Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia signed an executive order removing 6,303 voters suspected of being non-citizens from Virginia's voter rolls.[50][51] In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the Virginia Board of Elections and Virginia commissioner of elections over the voter purge, alleging that it violated the National Voter Registration Act.[52][53] The suit also found a number of alleged non-citizens purged were actually citizens.[53][54] District judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the removal was illegal, ordering the state to stop purging voter rolls and to restore the voter registration of more than 1,600 voters who had been removed.[55][54] The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals then upheld the order.[56][57] The administration filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which sided with Virginia in a 6–3 decision along ideological lines, allowing the state to continue purging voter rolls.[57][58]

In August 2024, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen announced a process for purging 3,251 registered Alabama voters and referred them to the state attorney general's office for criminal prosecution.[44][59] In September 2024, the Department of Justice sued Alabama for violating the National Voter Registration Act.[60][61] In October 2024, district judge Anna Manasco ruled in favor of the Department of Justice, ordering the state to restore the voter registrations.[62][63] Alabama secretary of state's chief of staff Clay Helms testified that 2,000 of the purged voters were legally registered citizens.[63]

## Criminal trials and indictments against Donald Trump
Main article: Indictments against Donald Trump
Further information: Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case), Georgia election racketeering prosecution, Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case), Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York, and Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump
Trump was found liable in civil proceedings for both sexual abuse and defamation in 2023 and defamation in 2024, while also being criminally convicted of 34 felonies related to falsifying business records, expected to be an issue during the campaign. As of December 2023, he had four criminal indictments totaling 86 felony counts and there are other lawsuits against Trump.[64] On May 30, 2024, Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump over falsifying business records for hush money payments to pornographic film star Stormy Daniels, to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them, to influence the 2016 presidential election. This made Trump the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime in American history.[65] Trump and many Republicans have made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trump's criminal trials, including false claims that they are "rigged" or "election interference" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there is no evidence.[66][12]


## Classified intelligence material found inside Mar-a-Lago in 2022
Trump faced an additional 52 felony counts: 4 counts in United States of America v. Donald J. Trump for his alleged role in attempting to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election and involvement in the January 6 United States Capitol attack; 8 counts in The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. for his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia; and 40 counts in United States of America v. Donald J. Trump, Waltine Nauta, and Carlos De Oliveira relating to his hoarding of classified documents and alleged obstruction of efforts to retrieve them.[67] In addition to his indictments, Trump was found liable on May 9, 2023, by an anonymous jury,[68] in E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump for sexual abuse/rape,[b][c] and ordered to pay a total of $88.3 million combined for damages and defamation.[74][75][76] In September 2023, Trump was found guilty of financial fraud in New York v. Trump and ordered to pay a $457 million judgement that he appealed.[77]

Trump was noted for attempting to delay his trials until after the November election. On January 20, 2025, Trump could order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal charges he is facing, prevent the state charges from taking effect through a variety of methods, and issue a presidential self-pardon.[78][79] On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court delivered its 6–3 decision in Trump v. United States, along ideological lines, ruling that Trump had absolute immunity for acts he committed as president within his core constitutional purview, at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility, and no immunity for unofficial acts.[80][81][82] Thus, Trump's sentencing date for his convictions in New York was delayed from July to September 2024,[83] and then to November 26,[84] and the trial dates in Trump's other cases would likely also be delayed to review the applicability of the Supreme Court's decision.[85][86]

## Age and health concerns

### Joe Biden
Main article: Age and health concerns about Joe Biden
Former president Trump, lawmakers, and mass media raised concerns about President Biden's age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States presidential election.[87] These concerns increased after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.[88] In July 2024, Biden withdrew his candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the conclusion of his term.[89] According to a February 2024 poll, Biden's age and health were major or moderate concerns for 86% of voters generally,[87] up from 76% in 2020.[90] According to another February 2024 poll, most of those who voted for Biden in 2020 believed he was too old to be an effective president; The New York Times noted that these concerns "cut across generations, gender, race and education".[91] In mid-2024, one expert noted an increase in expressions of all-or-nothing thinking by Biden. A sharp rise in all-or-nothing thinking is also linked to cognitive decline.[92]

### Donald Trump
Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump
In the summer before the election, polling showed at least half of Americans thought that Trump, who is 78 years old, was too old to serve a second term, with 80% unsure he would be able to finish out a second term.[93] Numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals speculated that Trump may have some form of dementia, which runs in his family.[94] Experts for the science publication STAT who analyzed changes in Trump's speeches between 2015 and 2024 noted shorter sentences, more tangents, more repetition, and more confusion of words and phrases. Doctors suggested these changes could relate to Trump's moods or could indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's. One expert noted an increase in expressions of all-or-nothing thinking by Trump. A sharp rise in all-or-nothing thinking is also linked to cognitive decline.[92] The New York Times reported that Trump's 2024 speeches had grown "darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more profane and increasingly fixated on the past", and that experts considered this increase in tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition as a possible consequence of advancing age and cognitive decline.[95] Trump was also criticized for his lack of transparency around his medical records and health.[96][94]

## Violent rhetoric

See also: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Violent and dehumanizing statements

On July 14, Biden gave an address condemning political violence, including the attempted assassination of Trump, arguing for the need to "lower the temperature" in American politics.
Several scholars, lawmakers, intelligence agencies, and the members of the public expressed concerns about political violence surrounding the 2024 election.[97][98] The fears came amidst increasing threats and acts of physical violence targeting public officials and election workers at all levels of government.[99][100] Trump was identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the United States both for and against him.[101][102][103] Political violence was at its highest since the 1970s, and the most recent violence came from right-wing assailants.[104][105] Trump increasingly embraced far-right extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president.[106][107] Trump also espoused dehumanizing, combative, and violent rhetoric,[108] and promised retribution against his political enemies.[109] Trump played down but refused to rule out violence following the 2024 election, stating "it depends".[110] Trump also suggested using the military against "the enemy from within" on Election Day that he described as "radical left lunatics", Democratic politicians, and those opposed to his candidacy.[111][112]
